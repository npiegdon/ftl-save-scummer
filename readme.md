## FTL Save Scummer

Run this in the background while playing FTL.  Each time your save file is modified, this app will backup the save automatically.

**Periodically** while playing when you reach a known-good checkpoint:

1. Click any of the icons in the Save Scummer interface to tag your most recent save game (or whichever one is currently selected).
2. The game is rather "chatty" with its save files.  Once you've tagged all the saves you're interested in keeping, click the "clean up" broom icon near the lower-right to automatically delete all backups that haven't been tagged with an icon. 

To **restore**:

1. Exit to main menu in FTL.
2. Click the green, "Go back in time" icon at the lower-right corner.
3. Click the Continue button inside FTL.

Works great with a **Stream Deck**:

1. Import the provided Stream Deck profile from the `\Stream Deck` folder to your device.
2. The Stream Deck buttons should behave the same as those in the UI, except now you never have to leave the game.  The restore operation plays a chime to let you know it triggered.
3. For tag buttons with several icons, keep pressing the button to cycle through the tags.  (This works best with multiple monitors or while playing FTL in a window.) 


### To-Do
